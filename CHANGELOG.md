# CHANGELOG - LivePortrait Batch Processor

## v5.0 - Enhanced with Detailed Progress (2025-07-02)

### 🎯 Major Improvements
- **FIXED**: Parallel processing issues - simplified approach that actually works
- **ADDED**: Option to skip already processed folders or reprocess everything  
- **ADDED**: Detailed progress showing individual file completion times and filenames
- **ENHANCED**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **OPTIMIZED**: Memory management for large batches

### 🚀 New Features

- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates showing:
  ```
  ✅ [1/23] selfie.jpg - 4.2s
  ✅ [2/23] license.jpg - 3.8s  
  ❌ [3/23] photo.jpg - Failed: File not found
  ```
- **Folder Management Options**:
  - Skip already processed folders (faster)
  - Reprocess all folders including completed ones
- **Enhanced Results Display**:
  - Per-folder breakdown with success rates
  - Average processing times
  - Detailed error reporting
  - Performance metrics

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Template Support**: PKL template processing for 10x speed improvement
- **State Management**: Better resume functionality with detailed progress tracking
- **Configuration**: Enhanced config management with validation
- **Logging**: Improved logging with detailed task tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Better retry logic and error reporting

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed parallel processing crashes on Windows
- Fixed progress tracking accuracy
- Fixed memory leaks in long-running batches
- Fixed folder renaming issues
- Fixed template path handling
